Indian cricket walks out in blue and pride,
From dusty maidans to stadiums wide.
A bat meets hope with a fearless sound,
Dreams rise every time the ball hits the ground.

From Gavaskar’s grit to Tendulkar’s grace,
History lives in every crease and face.
Kapil’s leap at Lord’s still echoes loud,
A nation roaring, fearless and proud.

Dhoni’s calm eyes, a finisher’s art,
Pressure melts around his steady heart.
Kohli’s fire, a relentless flame,
Chasing runs, chasing the game.

Rohit’s timing, pure and free,
Double hundreds, poetry in motion we see.
Bumrah’s run-up, strange yet true,
Wickets fall when he comes through.

Spin weaves magic, Jadeja and Ashwin,
Turning matches with subtle spin.
From Tests of patience to T20 speed,
Indian cricket adapts to every need.

Losses teach, victories unite,
Every match is a nation’s fight.
More than a sport, it’s a shared belief,
Indian cricket—joy, pain, and relief.
